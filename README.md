# num-str
Playing around with common practices of JavaScript/React.js

This is to be a number-to-string generator, bootstrapped with Create-React-App and the number-to-words api from npm.
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the idea that building code from scratch gives you a better foundation to work from,
however, it is far more professional and intelligent to use whatever tools you have at your finger tips in order to get a project 
done right, and on time. There is no use in reinventing the wheel if it is not necessary! While it is important to understand how
this api works, it is far more valuable to know how React.js handles the data when it comes to state management. That is a
fundamental concept of React.js that when understood, will make a better developer overall.
